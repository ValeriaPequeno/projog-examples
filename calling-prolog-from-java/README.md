Provides an example of how you can interact with a Prolog inference engine from a Java application.

`src/main/java/com/example/ProjogExample.java` demonstrates how to:

1. Create a new instance of `org.projog.api.Projog`
2. Load rules and facts, written in Prolog, from a file (`src/main/resources/test.pl`).
3. Run queries, written in Prolog, which use the rules and facts.
